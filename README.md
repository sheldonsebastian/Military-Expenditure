## Introduction

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of the countryâ€™s economic health.

Military expenditure is the expenditure by a country's government on their military forces, i.e. maintenance and operations, military research and development, Military aid, procurement, salaries, pensions, etc. World military spending refers to the aggregate global military spending by different countries - analysis of this data can help understand the status of a particular country as a military power in the world arena.

We will analyze military expenditure of 10 countries and their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We additionally want to find trends and draw conclusions.

## Comparing Military Expenditure and GDP:

We will compare Military Expenditure and GDP from 2014 to 2018 for the following 10 countries:
